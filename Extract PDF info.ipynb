xplanation of Code Changes:
Regular Expression Patterns:
objection_pattern = re.compile(r'Objection\s*\d+\s*[:;]?', re.IGNORECASE) captures "Objection" followed by any number of digits (\d+), optional spaces (\s*), and optionally either a colon or semicolon ([:;]?).
response_pattern = re.compile(r'Response\s*\d+\s*:', re.IGNORECASE) captures "Response" followed by any number of digits and a colon, with optional spaces before the colon.
