Hi Team,

I'm reaching out to discuss whether we should include other teams' objection responses in our template. Currently, I understand that some of us are including these responses, while others are not. I’d like to align on our approach and get your input.

Overview of the Options:

Option 1: Including Other Teams' Objections

Pros: This saves time, as we can request that State Filing uses our template exclusively.
Cons: We rely on our segregation mechanism to exclude other teams' objections. Our current method for identifying R&P objections is based on a keyword search. If all subtopics contain only R&P-related terms, we exclude them from our analysis. However, if there’s an R&P-related tag alongside an indication-related word, we keep it in the analysis.
Out of 265 objections reviewed, we identified only 19 that were strictly R&P. The method has been working well, but there’s a potential issue I’m considering: if there are phrases like “written premium” that would fall under the BL SAS team, these could be tagged as R&P due to similar keywords. Although I haven’t encountered this yet, it’s a possibility to keep in mind.
Option 2: Using Only Our Own Objections

Pros: This provides a more accurate count for our objection database.
Cons: It adds another step, as we’ll need to copy and paste objection responses manually.
I’d love to hear your thoughts on which approach you think we should take. Once we align, we can inform both the team and State Filing.

Thanks,
Simran
